<p>Hello! I'm Graham Field, a certified Data Analyst based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Beyond my professional life, I am passionate about the great outdoors and watersports, finding joy and exhilaration in activities like kayaking, sailing, and hiking. My love for nature is matched by my enthusiasm for gaming and computers, where I indulge my curiosity and continually seek out new challenges and knowledge.<p>

<p>Naturally inquisitive from a young age, I've always been eager to explore and understand the world around me. This curiosity fuels my work in data analytics, where I delve deep into data to uncover insights and solve complex problems. Whether navigating the open waters or decoding a challenging dataset, I approach each task with dedication and a desire to learn and grow.</p>
