            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The renewable energy industry has seen massive growth over the years given the importance of moving away from fossil fuels. One of the most effective ways of producing renewable energy is through wind. A global leader in this transition has been Germany.
The growth of the wind industry has many aspects to it, both technologically and geographically. With limited space and limited suitable areas for building wind farms the drive to make turbines more powerful and efficient is a major driving force in the industry.
Understanding how the new technologies have improved and how this has led to large increases in production capacity and physical dimensions of the turbines makes for an interesting study. Perhaps shedding light on the future of the industry.

            <h2>Step 1: Initial Data Exploration and Cleaning</h2>
  </p>This is open-source data from the German Data Register (Marktstammdatenregister). 

This data is regularly updated and free to use for research purposes.
    
There were several columns with NAN values, to deal with this I dropped many of the columns that were not necessary or irrelevant or not applicable, such as water depth for onshore turbines. The remaining NANs were either deleted. Several of the columns were merged which completed the data in those columns. Ultimately the data that I worked with with Python the data was relatively easy to clean and organise. 

Further l exploratory analysis confirmed that there were no duplicates, and the remaining missing values before being removed constituted approximately 2.5% these were also generally data points that represent wind parks in the planning or construction phase and have not yet been commissioned.
From the Data cleaning and exploration I have learned that the offshore industrial zone has its own column but I can also consider this as an additional state for the purposes of this case study. This greatly reduced the number of NANs and missing data in the State, ClusterNordsee, and ClusterOstsee Columns.</p>
