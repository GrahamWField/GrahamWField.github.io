  <p>Posted by Graham Field on March 10, 2024 â€“ 10 mins read</p>
  
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p><b>Duration of the project:</b> 1 week</p>
  <p><b>Role:</b> Data Analyst</p>
  <p><b>Tools:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Tableau</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Data:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Relational Database</li>
    <li>2 Fact tables and 13 Dimension Tables</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?</li>
    <li>What was the average rental duration for all videos?</li>
    <li>Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?</li>
    <li>Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?</li>
    <li>Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.</p>

  <h3>Getting to Know the Data</h3>
  <p>I began by creating a diagram of the tables which resembled a snowflake pattern, in addition to this I created a data dictionary which I needed for the joins later on. I started to search for duplicate and missing records to make sure my data was complete and consistent.</p>
  <p>Next was describing the data so that I could have some idea what I was working with. For example this SQL query is calculating the mode (most frequently occurring value) for several columns in the film table from a PostgreSQL database. The query uses the MODE() function within the GROUP BY clause to achieve this.</p>
  <p>We can use this to find things like most popular film genre, longest movie, average movie rental, which genres contribute the most revenue, where are the most loyal customers and which are restrictions are the most popular.</p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <h4>High Customer and Payment Countries:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>India, China, and the United States: These countries have the largest red circles, indicating they have generated the highest total payments. They are also shaded in darker blue, suggesting a higher number of customers.</li>
    <li>Other notable countries: Brazil, Japan, and Russia also have significant red circles, indicating substantial payments and a good number of customers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Moderate Customer and Payment Countries:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Countries like Canada, Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom have moderate red circles and are shaded in medium blue, indicating a moderate number of customers and payments.</li>

  <h4>Low Customer and Payment Countries:</h4>

  <h3>Reflections</h3>
  <p>My journey with SQL has been both enjoyable and enlightening. One of the aspects I enjoyed the most about using SQL is its powerful ability to handle and manipulate large datasets efficiently. The process of writing queries, optimizing them, and seeing immediate results has been incredibly satisfying. Each successful query felt like solving a puzzle, and the clarity it brought to complex data was immensely rewarding. While I have achieved a lot, I am excited to continue my learning journey and explore the vast possibilities that SQL offers. With continuous effort and curiosity, I aim to master SQL and leverage its full potential in my future projects.</p>
